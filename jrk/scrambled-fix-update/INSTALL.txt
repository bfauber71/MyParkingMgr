SCRAMBLED IMAGE FIX - Quick Update
===================================

WHAT THIS FIXES:
- Scrambled/skewed logos on Zebra printer
- Image appearing distorted or corrupted
- Logo not printing correctly

FILE TO UPLOAD:
✓ zpl-image-converter.php

WHERE TO PUT IT:
Upload to: includes/zpl-image-converter.php

(Replace the existing file on your server)

INSTALLATION STEPS:
===================

1. UPLOAD FILE:
   - On your server (2clv.com via FTP/cPanel):
   - Navigate to: includes/ folder
   - Upload: zpl-image-converter.php
   - Overwrite the existing file

2. RE-UPLOAD YOUR LOGO:
   - Login to your app as admin
   - Go to: Settings → Printer Settings
   - Click "Upload Logo"
   - Select your logo file (PNG/JPG)
   - Check "Enable Top Logo"
   - Click "Save Settings"

3. TEST:
   - Print any violation ticket
   - Click "Download ZPL for Zebra Printer"
   - Print on Zebra ZQ510
   - Logo should now print CLEARLY (not scrambled!)

WHAT WAS FIXED:
===============
- Disabled ZPL compression (was causing scrambling)
- Now uses uncompressed hex format (100% reliable)
- Image data is larger but prints perfectly
- No more distorted/skewed logos!

TECH DETAILS:
- Old: Used run-length encoding compression
- New: Uses uncompressed hex (more stable)
- File size: ~50-100KB per logo (still small)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================
If logo still scrambled:
1. Make sure you re-uploaded logo AFTER updating file
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Try a simpler logo (high contrast, bold design)
4. Check PHP has GD extension: php -m | grep gd

That's it! Just 1 file to upload, then re-upload your logo.
