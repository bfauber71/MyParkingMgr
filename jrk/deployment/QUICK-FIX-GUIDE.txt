QUICK FIX GUIDE - "Nothing Clicks" After Login
================================================================================

PROBLEM: After successful login, you can't click anything. Vehicles, properties,
and users don't load. Tabs don't respond.

ROOT CAUSE: The JavaScript file was incomplete and missing critical functions.

================================================================================
FASTEST FIX (2 Minutes)
================================================================================

1. Download: myparkingmanager-v2.3.0-update.zip (15 KB)

2. Extract ALL 5 files:
   ✓ index.html
   ✓ assets/app-secure.js
   ✓ .htaccess
   ✓ includes/database.php
   ✓ api/csrf-token.php

3. Upload to your server (overwrite existing files)

4. Clear browser cache:
   - Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+Delete > Clear all
   - Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete > Clear all
   - Safari: Cmd+Option+E

5. Login again - EVERYTHING WILL NOW WORK!

================================================================================
WHAT GOT FIXED
================================================================================

✓ index.html now loads the COMPLETE JavaScript file
✓ Vehicles section now loads from database  
✓ Properties section displays all your properties
✓ Users section shows user management
✓ All tabs are clickable
✓ All buttons respond
✓ Data displays correctly

Your database was never broken - the frontend just wasn't loading it!

================================================================================
VERIFICATION STEPS
================================================================================

After applying the update:

1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Visit your application URL
3. Login with your credentials
4. You should immediately see:
   ✓ Vehicles tab with search bar
   ✓ Properties tab (if you have admin/operator role)
   ✓ Database tab (admin only)
   ✓ Violations tab
   ✓ All existing data from database

If you still don't see data:
- Check that you're logged in as Admin or Operator
- Regular users need to be assigned to properties
- Verify database actually contains data (check phpMyAdmin)

================================================================================
STILL HAVING ISSUES?
================================================================================

If the fix doesn't work:

1. Verify all 5 files were uploaded
2. Check file permissions (644 for files, 755 for folders)
3. Look at browser console for errors (F12 > Console tab)
4. Check PHP error logs on your server
5. Ensure your .htaccess RewriteBase matches your installation path

Common issues:
- "Address already in use" - restart web server
- "500 Internal Server Error" - check .htaccess path
- "Database connection failed" - verify config.php

================================================================================
FILE CHECKSUMS
================================================================================

Verify your update package integrity:

SHA256: 8057d80a7ac12db3358b44bdb35a44e2954982e4fba751404cfb0483a75ffe1b

After upload, these files should be updated:
- index.html (last modified should be recent)
- assets/app-secure.js (should be ~29KB)
- .htaccess (should include RewriteBase)
- includes/database.php (should include endpoint whitelist)
- api/csrf-token.php (should exist)
