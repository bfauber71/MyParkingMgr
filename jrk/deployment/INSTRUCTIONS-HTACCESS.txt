MyParkingManager - .htaccess Fix Instructions
====================================================================

Your app isn't working because the .htaccess file has the wrong path.

STEP 1: Determine Your Installation Path
-----------------------------------------

What URL do you use to access your app?

A) https://2clv.com/
   → Use: htaccess-ROOT.txt

B) https://2clv.com/parking/ (or any subdirectory)
   → Tell me the subdirectory name, I'll create the right file


STEP 2: Upload the Correct File
-----------------------------------------

1. Download htaccess-ROOT.txt (or the custom one I create for you)
2. Rename it to: .htaccess (with the dot at the beginning)
3. Upload to your server where index.php is located
4. OVERWRITE the existing .htaccess file
5. Make sure file permissions are set to 644


STEP 3: Test
-----------------------------------------

Visit your app URL and try logging in again.
Everything should now work!


TROUBLESHOOTING
-----------------------------------------

If it still doesn't work:
- Make sure the file is named .htaccess (not htaccess.txt)
- Check file permissions: should be 644
- Tell me the EXACT URL you use to access the app
