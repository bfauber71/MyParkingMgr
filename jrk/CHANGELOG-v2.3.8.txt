MyParkingManager v2.3.8 - CHANGELOG
====================================================================

RELEASE DATE: November 8, 2024

====================================================================
NEW FEATURES
====================================================================

1. GUEST PASS GENERATION SYSTEM
   - Create temporary guest vehicle records with 7-day auto-expiration
   - Professional letter-size guest pass printing with property logo
   - Displays vehicle details and expiration date
   - EXPIRED status shown in red for expired guest passes in search

2. TICKET STATUS MANAGEMENT
   - Close parking tickets by marking fines as "collected" or "dismissed"
   - Dedicated Ticket Status screen with status filters (Active/Closed)
   - Property-based filtering for multi-property deployments
   - Comprehensive audit logging of all status changes
   - Database tracks: status, fine_disposition, closed_at, closed_by_user_id

====================================================================
BUG FIXES
====================================================================

1. CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: Ticket Access Control
   - Fixed unauthorized ticket access vulnerability in tickets-list.php
   - Added property membership verification for both vehicle records AND bare tickets
   - WHERE clause now requires: (v.id IS NOT NULL AND v.property IN (...)) OR 
     (v.id IS NULL AND vt.property_name IN (...))

2. PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT FIX: .htaccess Redirect Loop
   - Fixed infinite redirect loop causing 500 errors on shared hosting
   - Changed routing from index.php to index.html (line 24)
   - Prevents redirect loops on production servers like 2clv.com

3. GUEST PASS FORM: Duplicate Apartment Field
   - Removed duplicate "Apartment / Unit" field from guest pass form
   - Now only asks once for "Visiting Apt/Unit" (where guest is visiting)
   - Cleaner, less confusing user interface

4. TICKET PRINTING: Violation Spacing
   - Removed excessive spacing between violations on printed tickets
   - Violations now print tightly together with minimal gaps
   - Only one single space after the last violation
   - Cleaner, more compact ticket layout

5. TICKET REPRINT: UI Improvements
   - Added "Reprint" button to Ticket Status screen for easy reprinting
   - Made print button more prominent on ticket print page
   - Added clear instructions to prevent accidental ZPL downloads
   - Print button now larger, blue, and clearly labeled for paper printers

6. ZPL PRINTING: Paper Advance
   - Added 1/2" paper feed at end of each ZPL ticket
   - Makes tickets easier to tear off from thermal printer
   - Advances paper automatically after printing completes

====================================================================

1. add-guest-pass-expiration.sql
   - Adds expiration_date DATE field to vehicles table
