WHAT THIS UPDATE DOES
================================================================================

✓ License Status Default:
  - Systems without license records now show "unlicensed" instead of
    "not_initialized"
  - Provides clearer status for systems that haven't been licensed yet

✓ Licensed User Splash Screen:
  - After successful login, licensed users see:
    "Licensed to: (customer_email)" for 5 seconds
  - Then automatically proceeds to main dashboard
  - Non-licensed users (trial, unlicensed, expired) go directly to dashboard

✓ Improved UX:
  - Licensed customers see confirmation of their license on every login
  - Cleaner status for unlicensed systems
  - No changes to core functionality
