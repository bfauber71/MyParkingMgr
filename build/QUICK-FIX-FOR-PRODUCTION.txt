# QUICK FIX: Trial Badge Showing "ERROR"

Your production site at 2clv.com is almost working!
The API calls are successful (200 responses), but the database is missing the license tables.

## What You Need To Do RIGHT NOW:

### Step 1: Open phpMyAdmin
- Login to your hosting control panel (cPanel)
- Click "phpMyAdmin"
- Select your database from the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run License Migration SQL

1. Click the "SQL" tab at the top
2. Open this file from your deployment: `sql/migrate-license-system.sql`
3. Copy ALL the contents
4. Paste into phpMyAdmin SQL box
5. Click "Go" button
6. Wait for "Query OK" messages

### Step 3: Refresh Your Website

1. Go back to: https://2clv.com
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Login again
4. ✅ The "TRIAL" badge should now appear in the top-right!

## What This Does:

Creates 3 database tables:
- license_instances (stores trial/license status)
- license_attempts (security monitoring)
- license_audit (change tracking)

And initializes your installation with a 30-day trial.

## If You Still See Errors:

1. Check browser console (F12 > Console tab)
2. Verify all 3 tables were created (check Tables list in phpMyAdmin)
3. Make sure the SQL ran without errors

That's it! Your production site should be fully working after this.
