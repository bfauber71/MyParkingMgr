# MyParkingManager v2.3.3 - Security Configuration

## HTTPS Enforcement

### Production Deployment ✅
The .htaccess file in the deployment package **ENFORCES HTTPS** for security:
```apache
# Redirect to HTTPS (REQUIRED for production security)
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
```

**This means:**
- All HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS
- Session cookies are sent over encrypted connections only
- Protects user credentials and sensitive data
- Meets security best practices for web applications

### SSL Certificate Required
Before deploying, ensure your hosting provider has:
- ✅ Valid SSL/TLS certificate installed
- ✅ HTTPS enabled on your domain
- ✅ Port 443 (HTTPS) accessible

Most shared hosting providers (cPanel, Plesk, etc.) offer free SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt.

### Development Environment
The development environment (Replit) has HTTPS redirect disabled to allow local testing over HTTP.

## Security Headers

The .htaccess also includes these security headers:
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN  
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block

## Protected Files

These files are blocked from web access:
- .htaccess (Apache config)
- config.php (database credentials)
- *.sql (database scripts)

**Ready for secure production deployment!** 🔒
