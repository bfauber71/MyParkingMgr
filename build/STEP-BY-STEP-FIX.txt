# STEP-BY-STEP FIX FOR 2clv.com

Your deployment is working! Just need to add the license tables.

## IMPORTANT: Re-download the deployment package first!
The previous version had a SQL syntax error. The NEW package has it fixed.

Download: MyParkingManager-v2.3.3-Deployment.zip (500KB)

---

## Step 1: Extract the NEW deployment package

Extract the ZIP file to your computer.

---

## Step 2: Open phpMyAdmin

1. Login to your cPanel
2. Click "phpMyAdmin"
3. Select database: "myparkingmanager" from left sidebar

---

## Step 3: Run the Fixed SQL

1. Click the "SQL" tab at the top
2. Find this file in the extracted folder: `sql/migrate-license-system.sql`
3. Open it with Notepad or TextEdit
4. Copy ALL the contents (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
5. Paste into the phpMyAdmin SQL box
6. Click "Go" button

You should see GREEN checkmarks with messages like:
- ✅ "Query OK, 0 rows affected" (creating tables)
- ✅ "1 row affected" (inserting license data)

---

## Step 4: Verify Tables Were Created

In phpMyAdmin, check the left sidebar under your database.
You should now see these NEW tables:
- license_instances
- license_attempts
- license_audit

---

## Step 5: Refresh Your Website

1. Go to: https://2clv.com
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
3. Login: admin / admin
4. ✅ Look for "TRIAL" badge in top-right corner!

---

## Step 6: Test Everything

1. Go to Settings > Violations
2. ✅ Should see all 10 violation types
3. Try adding a property
4. Try adding a vehicle

---

## If You Still Get Errors:

### Error: "Table already exists"
- That's OK! It means you already ran it partially
- The script will skip existing tables

### Error: "Column already exists"  
- That's OK! The script handles this

### Still seeing "License status: error"
- Check that all 3 license tables exist
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Send me a screenshot

---

That's it! Your production site will be fully working after this.

The SQL file is now compatible with MySQL 5.7, MariaDB 10.2, and all newer versions.
