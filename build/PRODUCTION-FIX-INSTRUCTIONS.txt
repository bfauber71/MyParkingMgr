# PRODUCTION FIX - Run This SQL File

## Problem
The previous SQL file used functions not available on your MySQL version.

## Solution
Use the NEW simple SQL file that's compatible with ALL MySQL/MariaDB versions.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### Step 1: Download the NEW Deployment Package
File: MyParkingManager-v2.3.3-Deployment.zip (500KB+)

This package includes the fixed SQL file.

---

### Step 2: Open phpMyAdmin on Production
1. Login to cPanel
2. Click "phpMyAdmin"
3. Select your database: "myparkingmanager"

---

### Step 3: Run the SIMPLE SQL File

**IMPORTANT:** Use this file instead:
- File: `sql/migrate-license-system-simple.sql`

1. Click "SQL" tab in phpMyAdmin
2. Open the file: `sql/migrate-license-system-simple.sql`
3. Copy ALL contents
4. Paste into the SQL box
5. Click "Go"

You should see GREEN checkmarks:
✅ "Query OK, 0 rows affected" (creating tables)
✅ "Query OK, 1 row affected" (inserting trial data)

---

### Step 4: Verify Tables Created

In phpMyAdmin left sidebar, you should see:
- license_instances (NEW)
- license_attempts (NEW)
- license_audit (NEW)

Click on `license_instances` and verify there's 1 row with:
- status: trial
- trial_expires_at: 30 days from now

---

### Step 5: Test Your Website

1. Go to: https://2clv.com
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Login with: admin / admin
4. ✅ "TRIAL" badge should appear in top-right!
5. Go to Settings > Violations
6. ✅ Should see all 10 violation types

---

## What's Different in This File?

The simple version:
- ✅ No JSON_OBJECT() function (not on older MySQL)
- ✅ No UUID() function (generates IDs with MD5 instead)
- ✅ Uses stored procedure for column check (100% compatible)
- ✅ Works on MySQL 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 8.0 and ALL MariaDB versions

---

## If You Still Get Errors:

Send me a screenshot of the exact error message from phpMyAdmin.

The error will show which line failed and why.
